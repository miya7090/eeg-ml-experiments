3/20 (current, uncommitted)
combining the Processing and Python code. moved serial functionality over to Python, etc.
next, will work on breaking Python code into functions for readability.
then will actually write those functions and test.
making major changes to file/folder/etc arrangement
3/19
program consists of Arduino -> Processing -> Python code.
functional except machine learning bits which aren't totally implemented.
Arduino writes to serial, Processing reads serial and writes to file, Python reads file and makes predictions etc
will work on switching over Processing code as Python also has serial functions.
